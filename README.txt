hello so this is a standerd install but couple things i need to make clear the .bat file i made specifically does not require admin heck all the development was done on a crappy school laptop to import your own game files pay 1 dollah to me i will be accepting snacks for a little bit(not permanant will most likely stop accepting depends) this tool is EXTREMLY buggy if any game requires the steam api in any capacity ex muck for servers cs2 (f it even runs)because of the matchmaking NOTE:some games might have save progress it should not affect you much but if its in something like undertale where it does please notify me so i can give instructions to perm delete the files
also NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RENAME THE INSTALATION FOLDER IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING
